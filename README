# What is this?
This scraper was writen to collect data about OUYA games from the OUYA Storefront and populate a Wikimedia driven site with said data.

# Who can use this?
Absolutely anyone, my gift to you. However, the OUYA storefront is closing soon so use it while you can.

# What all does it scrape?
It will pull all the data it can find, including APKs, Just not premium titles.

# Why Python 2.7?
This was an old script that I just decided to publish, it works and I never bothered to update it. Take it or leave it. :D
